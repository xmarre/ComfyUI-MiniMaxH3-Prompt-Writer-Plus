# External llama.cpp server

External llama.cpp is the advanced local provider for users who want to control the inference runtime. It is also an alternative when a Direct `llama-cpp-python` wheel is incompatible with the system.

## Quick setup

1. Get a current `llama-server` from the [official llama.cpp project](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp).
2. Download a model GGUF. Download its matching `mmproj` if you want Writer to read images or video.
3. Start the server from the directory containing `llama-server`:

```powershell
.\llama-server.exe -m "C:\models\model.gguf" --mmproj "C:\models\mmproj.gguf" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --ctx-size 24576 --alias h3-vision
```

On Linux or macOS, use `./llama-server` and the appropriate file paths.

For Music 3, T2VA, ordinary text-only Refine, and workflow-only H3 Continuum, you can run the same model without `--mmproj`:

```powershell
.\llama-server.exe -m "C:\models\model.gguf" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --ctx-size 24576 --alias prompt-writer
```

4. Open **H3 Prompt Writer > Settings > External llama.cpp**.
5. Enter `http://127.0.0.1:8080` as **Server URL**.
6. Leave **Model ID** empty when the server exposes one model. If it exposes several, enter the exact `/v1/models` ID or the value passed with `--alias`.
7. Select **Connect**, return to the workspace, and run a request that matches the model's capabilities.

The command uses current official llama.cpp options. Adjust context, GPU layers, cache types, and other runtime settings for your hardware. The server's default host is loopback and its default port is 8080.

## What Writer controls

Writer prepares the brief and prompt instructions. When the server supports vision, Writer can also send images and video contact sheets. It sends a Chat Completions request and can cancel its active HTTP request.

In ComfyUI, **Auto VRAM** can release idle ComfyUI workflow models before an External request. It does not start, stop, or unload the external server or its model.

The external server controls:

- model and projector loading;
- GPU placement and offload;
- context size and KV cache;
- generated-token limits;
- chat-template reasoning behavior and reasoning output format;
- build flags and runtime optimizations;
- server startup, shutdown, sleep, and model unload.

Writer does not send `enable_thinking` or other reasoning controls to External llama.cpp. If the server returns reasoning through `reasoning_content` or a leading `<think>` block, Writer keeps it out of the final H3 prompt.

Changing provider, disconnecting, cancelling, or closing Writer does not stop `llama-server` or unload its model.

## Connection contract

Writer accepts local loopback HTTP servers. Use a root URL such as:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Entering `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` is also accepted and normalized to the server root. Arbitrary additional paths are rejected.

During connection, Writer checks `/health`, `/props`, and `/v1/models`. A text-only model can connect and handle Music 3, T2VA, ordinary text-only Refine, and H3 Continuum requests whose visual conditioning remains workflow-only.

Prompt Writer requests that actually attach images or video for model analysis need vision support from a matching model and projector, including visual I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, and Reference. Workflow-only H3 Continuum conditioning is metadata and does not itself require `--mmproj`. If a text-only model receives visual analysis media, Writer stops before generation and explains how to enable vision.

## Advanced use

Use `--alias` when you want a stable API Model ID. Current llama.cpp also supports options such as `--gpu-layers`, `--cache-type-k`, `--cache-type-v`, `--flash-attn`, and `--split-mode`. Keep these on the server command line; Writer does not duplicate them.

Gemma 4 is the main tested model family for External llama.cpp. The provider is not restricted to Gemma 4. You can try another model supported by your llama.cpp build. Add its matching projector when you need vision. Compatibility does not guarantee the same prompt quality.

External/API providers only show **Cancel** during a request. Prompt-model unload controls do not apply because Writer does not own their process or model lifetime.
