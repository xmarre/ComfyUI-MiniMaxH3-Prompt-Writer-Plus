# Troubleshooting

This page primarily covers the ComfyUI extension. Standalone users should start with the [Standalone setup guide](../standalone/README.md). The `llama-cpp-python` and ComfyUI VRAM instructions below do not apply to Standalone Local GGUF.

Start by updating H3 Prompt Writer, restarting ComfyUI, and using `Ctrl+F5` if the browser still shows an older interface. The entries below describe problems that can still occur in v0.4.4.

## I installed it but cannot find a node

**Symptom**

ComfyUI Manager reports that the extension has no nodes, or nothing new appears in the graph.

**Cause**

H3 Prompt Writer is a UI extension, not a workflow node.

**Fix**

Open the floating **H3 Prompt Writer** button or use **Extensions > H3 Prompt Writer**. If neither is present, confirm that the repository is directly below `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`, restart ComfyUI, and check the startup console for an import error.

**Verify**

The Writer window opens. No graph node is expected.

## Direct runtime is not installed

**Symptom**

Direct GGUF says `llama-cpp-python is not installed` after the extension itself was installed.

**Cause**

Direct uses an optional native runtime. ComfyUI Manager installs the base extension but does not install this CUDA-specific package.

**Fix**

For the NVIDIA Windows Portable build used for v0.3 validation, open a terminal in the folder containing `python_embeded` and run:

```powershell
.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu130 "llama-cpp-python==0.3.35"
```

Restart ComfyUI.

**Verify**

Open **Settings > Direct GGUF**. Settings shows an accepted `llama-cpp-python` package as **Runtime detected**.

## Direct runtime is installed but broken

**Symptom**

The first Direct model load fails with `MODEL_LOAD_FAILED`, an import error, a missing native symbol, or another native runtime error.

**Cause**

The package can be installed in the wrong Python environment, come from an incompatible wheel, or retain mixed native files after an environment-changing update.

**Fix**

From the Windows Portable folder containing `python_embeded`, perform one clean replacement:

```powershell
.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip uninstall llama-cpp-python -y
.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install --no-cache-dir --only-binary=:all: --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu130 "llama-cpp-python==0.3.35"
```

Do not install into system Python, copy native DLLs manually, or replace ComfyUI's embedded Python files.

**Verify**

Restart ComfyUI and complete a real Direct model load and generation.

If Gemma is available but a Qwen model says the runtime is unsupported, check Scan details. Gemma remains supported on 0.3.34, while the validated Qwen adapters require 0.3.35 or newer. Use the clean replacement command above; Writer blocks Qwen before loading weights when the installed runtime is too old.

## `GGML_TYPE_F16` cannot be imported

**Symptom**

Technical details include `cannot import name 'GGML_TYPE_F16' from 'llama_cpp'`.

**Cause**

The Python files and native package are inconsistent or are not the validated runtime. Workflow safetensors are unrelated.

**Fix**

Use the clean Direct-runtime replacement command from the previous entry in the Python environment that launches ComfyUI.

**Verify**

Restart ComfyUI and confirm that a real Direct model load succeeds.

## Direct is extremely slow or runs on CPU

**Symptom**

Direct generation is much slower than expected or runs mainly on CPU.

**Cause**

A CPU-only or incompatible `llama-cpp-python` wheel can import without providing the intended CUDA backend.

**Fix**

Install the wheel matching the Python and CUDA environment used by ComfyUI. The command above is validated only for the NVIDIA Windows Portable CUDA 13.0 build used for v0.3 validation. For another environment, use a compatible prebuilt wheel rather than assuming the cu130 command applies.

**Verify**

A real Direct generation completes without the CPU-only slowdown.

## Windows `0xC000001D` illegal instruction

**Symptom**

ComfyUI exits completely or Direct fails with `MODEL_LOAD_FAILED`, Windows `0xC000001D`, or `Illegal instruction` during the first native model load.

**Cause**

This is a native CPU-instruction failure. Wrong, mixed, or stale binaries can cause it. The current prebuilt `llama-cpp-python 0.3.34 cu130` wheel also contains AVX512 instructions, which creates a portability risk on CPUs without AVX512. The exact cause of every remote report is not proven without that machine's binary hash and crash details.

**Fix**

Try the clean replacement command once, because it can correct a wrong or mixed installation. Restart and retry. If the same `0xC000001D` remains, do not reinstall the same wheel repeatedly. Use the recommended [Ollama](OLLAMA.md) path or [External llama.cpp](EXTERNAL_LLAMA_SERVER.md) with a build suitable for the CPU.

The clean reinstall does not rebuild the wheel or disable AVX512.

**Verify**

A real Direct model load completes without terminating ComfyUI.

## Direct model or vision projector is not found

**Symptom**

Direct shows no models, or an installed model is marked text-only because its projector is missing or ambiguous.

**Cause**

Writer needs a model GGUF and the Direct runtime for text generation. Visual modes additionally need one matching model-class projector in the same scanned folder. Writer does not guess among several projector candidates.

**Fix**

Put the model under `ComfyUI/models/LLM`. To enable I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, or Reference, put its verified projector beside it. Projector detection uses GGUF metadata, so renaming the file does not disable detection. Compatible quant files can share one projector in the same folder. Select **Refresh**, then open **Scan details** to see every searched path and file.

Do not reuse a projector from another model class just because its filename looks compatible.

Without an unambiguous compatible projector, the model remains available for T2VA and Refine. Writer disables the visual modes and Music 3 instead of blocking all Direct work.

**Verify**

The model appears under **Installed models**. A text-only setup completes T2VA and workflow-only H3 Continuum requests; a paired vision setup also completes a real Prompt Writer image-analysis request.

## Ollama is not running

**Symptom**

Ollama Settings show **Start Ollama** and the selected service does not respond.

**Cause**

Writer does not start the Ollama application or service. A custom host may also be unavailable from this computer.

**Fix**

For the default host, open the Ollama app and wait for the local service to start. For a custom host, check its root URL, network listener, and firewall. Then select **Check now**.

**Verify**

Settings advance to Prompt model and show installed compatible models.

## An Ollama model is not available

**Symptom**

Ollama is ready, but the model picker is empty or does not contain the expected tag.

**Cause**

The exact tag has not been pulled, the pull is still running, or Ollama does not report the installed model as vision capable.

**Fix**

Run a command such as:

```text
ollama pull gemma4:e4b
```

After it finishes, select **Refresh** in Ollama Settings. Writer never downloads the model itself.

**Verify**

The exact tag appears in **Prompt model** and a real image request completes.

## External llama.cpp cannot connect

**Symptom**

External Settings cannot reach the server or report an invalid URL.

**Cause**

`llama-server` is stopped, uses another port, listens on another interface, or the URL contains an unsupported path.

**Fix**

Start `llama-server` and enter its loopback root, normally:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

An input ending in `/v1` is accepted and normalized. Remove any other added path. Confirm that `/health` and `/v1/models` respond.

**Verify**

External Settings show the connected model. A text-only model is ready for Music 3, T2VA, ordinary text-only Refine, and workflow-only H3 Continuum. If you started the server with a projector, confirm vision with a real image request.

## Vision is unavailable

**Symptom**

A server or Custom endpoint connects, but Writer refuses image or video references.

**Cause**

The loaded model is text-only, its matching projector is missing, or the OpenAI-compatible model list does not advertise image support.

**Fix**

For External llama.cpp, restart with the model's matching `--mmproj`. You can keep using a text-only server for Music 3, T2VA, ordinary text-only Refine, and workflow-only H3 Continuum. For local LM Studio, load a vision model before reconnecting. For another Custom endpoint, enable **Endpoint accepts image_url inputs** only when both server and model support that contract.

**Verify**

The selected model shows **Vision** and completes a real image request.

## Continuum sequence or handoff failure

**Symptom**

Writer rejects a sequence plan, reports a failure at a specific chunk, cannot find a sampler, asks you to select one sampler, or says the Sequence Prompt source is not editable.

**Cause**

The prompt model returned an invalid semantic plan or chunk body; the Timeline text no longer has exact contiguous boundaries; the configured values are outside H3 Continuum's native 1–16 chunks and 4–30 seconds per chunk; the selected sampler is not using **Prompt Format = Timeline**; or the workflow does not expose one unambiguous a supported **H3 Continuum Sampler V3.4–V3.7** connected to an editable **Text (Multiline)** source.

**Fix**

Review the reported chunk and clarify the Creative Brief. A malformed plan receives one automatic structural repair; a second invalid plan stops instead of being guessed. Keep the shared preamble before the first Timeline header and keep every `[start-end]` header on its own line with exact boundaries derived from the configured chunk duration. Add or select exactly one compatible H3 Continuum sampler and connect an editable Text (Multiline) node to **Sequence Prompt**. When Prompt Format, chunk count, or chunk duration differs, review the proposed values before using **Sync settings & apply**.

**Verify**

The complete canonical Timeline appears in the connected text widget, **Prompt Format** is **Timeline**, sampler chunk values match Writer, Continuum resolves every section with the shared preamble, and the workflow accepts the prompt without Fixed fallback or parser warnings.

## Continuum sampler not found during generation or refinement

**Symptom**

Writer reports **Continuum sampler not found** before sequence generation or chunk refinement starts.

**Cause**

Continuum prompt identities are derived from the active H3 Continuum sampler conditioning topology. Without that sampler, Writer cannot know whether `<Picture N>` belongs to Reference Images, First/Last keyframes, or nothing at all.

**Fix**

Add a supported **H3 Continuum Sampler V3.4–V3.7** to the current workflow. If several compatible samplers are present, select exactly one on the canvas before generating or refining.

**Verify**

Generation reaches the sequence planner only after Writer can inspect the intended sampler. Workflow-only references may remain absent from Prompt Writer/Qwen media as long as their H3 Continuum conditioning inputs are connected and their roles are described in the Creative Brief.

## Continuum conditioning changed after generation

**Symptom**

Writer reports **Continuum conditioning changed** or the backend returns `CONTINUUM_REFERENCE_SOURCE_DRIFT` when refining or applying a saved sequence.

**Cause**

New Continuum sequences snapshot the normalized H3 Continuum downstream conditioning inventory used during planning. The active sampler now resolves one or more Reference Image, First Frame, Last Frame, Video Reference, or Driving Audio inputs to different observable workflow sources even though public tags such as `<Picture 1>` may still look unchanged.

**Fix**

Restore the original H3 Continuum conditioning wiring or regenerate the sequence against the current workflow. Writer does not silently reinterpret a saved sequence plan against a different reference/keyframe source.

**Verify**

Refine and **Apply to Continuum** proceed without a source-drift warning. Legacy saved sequences without an inventory snapshot remain readable and acquire the active snapshot after their next successful chunk refinement.

## Continuum chunk returned a standalone H3 wrapper

**Symptom**

A prompt model tries to return `integrated_multimodal_description:`, `subject_definitions:`, `[Shot 1]`, a standalone keyframe-alignment line, a Markdown fence, or repeats the shared sequence preamble inside one Timeline chunk.

**Cause**

The model followed a standalone H3 authoring habit instead of the dedicated Continuum chunk-body contract. Continuum already owns the outer Timeline boundaries and prepends the shared preamble to every resolved chunk.

**Fix**

Writer treats these shapes as objective chunk-format failures and makes one narrow Continuum-only text correction. The correction removes the wrapper or repeated preamble while preserving supported action, state, camera, dialogue, sound, and valid scoped reference tags.

**Verify**

The stored chunk body contains only local Continuum prompt prose. It has no shared-preamble duplicate, standalone H3 field labels, `[Shot N]` wrapper, or nested Timeline header.

## Continuum reference declaration failure

**Symptom**

Writer reports `CONTINUUM_REFERENCE_IDENTITY_DRIFT` for an undeclared public reference, or `CONTINUUM_REFERENCE_SCOPE_DRIFT` when a declared reference is used outside its valid chunk scope.

**Cause**

The Creative Brief, semantic plan, or generated chunk uses a public reference identity that the selected H3 Continuum sampler does not expose in that scope. With active **Reference Images**, those inputs own compact public `<Picture 1..N>` numbering and First/Last Frame stay untagged. Without Reference Images, active First/Last Frame keyframes own the compact Picture identities. **Video Reference** is `<Video 1>`; **Reference Audio** on V3.5+ is persistent `<Audio 1>`; **Driving Audio** has no `<Audio N>` tag. In multi-chunk keyframe runs, the opening Picture tag is valid only in Chunk 1 and the final Picture tag only in the final chunk. Prompt Writer uploads do not automatically inherit any downstream identity.

**Fix**

Select the intended H3 Continuum sampler and inspect its active conditioning inputs. With Reference Images, use their compact active-connection numbering; for example, physical Reference Image 2 and 5 become public `<Picture 1>` and `<Picture 2>`. Without Reference Images, use the temporal keyframe numbering derived from the connected First/Last inputs. Use `<Video 1>` only when Video Reference is connected. Use `<Audio 1>` only for connected Reference Audio on V3.5+; never create an `<Audio 1>` tag merely because Driving Audio is connected. Keep opening/final keyframe tags out of middle chunks and the shared preamble.

**Verify**

Generation reaches the planner and chunk writer without `CONTINUUM_REFERENCE_IDENTITY_DRIFT` or `CONTINUUM_REFERENCE_SCOPE_DRIFT`. Every public tag belongs to the selected downstream inventory and appears only in chunks where that conditioning identity is valid.

## API authentication, rate limit, or truncated response

**Symptom**

The provider rejects the key, reports quota/billing/rate limit, or generation fails because the response reached its length limit.

**Cause**

Authentication, quotas, pricing, context, and output limits are provider and model specific. A successful connection does not guarantee free quota or sufficient output budget.

**Fix**

Confirm the key and selected model in the provider's console. Check current billing and rate-limit status. For Gemini, try **Minimal** or a lower Thinking level when latency or token use is the concern. Do not treat a response with `finish_reason=length` as a complete H3 prompt; Writer rejects it.

**Verify**

The request ends normally and the full editable prompt appears. Technical details should not report authentication, rate-limit, billing, or length termination.

## Context, Thinking, or memory failure

**Symptom**

Writer reports `CONTEXT_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`, `THINKING_CONTEXT_INSUFFICIENT`, insufficient free VRAM, or a runtime out-of-memory error.

**Cause**

Context capacity and memory are different limits. A request can exceed the selected token context while VRAM remains available, or fit the model context but fail because the runtime cannot allocate memory.

**Fix**

For Direct Auto, let Writer select a supported preset. If a manual Context or Generation budget does not fit, increase Context or reduce the budget. Custom Context cannot exceed a native context reported by the GGUF. Reduce active references or use a model with a larger context limit when the request still does not fit.

For actual memory failure, use **Free ComfyUI VRAM**, close other GPU-heavy applications, select a smaller model, or reduce context. Do not increase context as a generic response to an OOM.

Ollama context is automatic in Writer; Ollama decides whether to offload parts of the model to CPU/RAM.

**Verify**

The next request completes without a context-limit or allocation error. If Thinking falls back, Writer reports it instead of presenting it as a full Thinking result.

## Reference prompt warning

**Symptom**

Writer says it repaired a missing reference tag or kept the original prompt with a format warning.

**Cause**

The first model draft omitted a required typed reference or failed an objective Reference format check. Pictures and videos are required. During Generate, uploaded audio is required only when the Creative Brief contains its exact `<Audio N>` tag. During Refine, existing audio tags remain required unless the revision instruction contains that exact tag, which makes the reference mutable for that revision.

**Fix**

When repair succeeds, review the corrected prompt. When it is rejected, the editor keeps the original prompt; remove irrelevant media, clarify each reference role in the Creative Brief, and generate again. A valid first draft is not rewritten.

**Verify**

Every active picture and video has its exact tag. Merely uploaded audio may remain unused. Refine preserves audio references not named by the revision instruction and accepts the prompt model's decision for each exact `<Audio N>` tag that the instruction does name. Every resulting reference tag exists in the current manifest.

## A reference transfers the wrong details

**Symptom**

A motion reference also changes the character, clothes, setting, lighting, or another detail that should come from a different file.

**Cause**

The Creative Brief did not limit the reference to a specific role, or the selected prompt model did not follow that limit closely enough.

**Fix**

State both the wanted role and the details that must not transfer. For example:

```text
Use only the movement and camera pacing from <Video 1>. Do not copy its performer, clothes, setting, lighting or audio. Keep the character appearance from <Picture 1> and the wardrobe from <Picture 2>.
```

Remove any active file that should not participate at all. Then generate again or use **Refine** with the same correction.

**Verify**

The final prompt names `<Video 1>` as the motion source while keeping appearance and wardrobe tied to the requested pictures.

## The interface looks old after updating

**Symptom**

Provider locations, labels, or controls do not match the current documentation.

**Cause**

The browser can retain an older extension script after files are updated.

**Fix**

Restart ComfyUI and hard-refresh the Writer page with `Ctrl+F5`.

**Verify**

Settings list Ollama, Direct GGUF, External llama.cpp, and API providers in that order.

## Collect technical details

Use the error's **Technical details** before changing the environment. It records the stage and available runtime information without assuming the user's diagnosis is correct.

Include the relevant ComfyUI console output when **Technical details** does not contain enough information.

Historical duplicate-upload, LAN `crypto.randomUUID`, and delayed-first-SSE External bugs were fixed in v0.2.1 or v0.3. Update first rather than applying old workarounds.
