  prompt: `### Global Metadata

A reflective indie pop song at a steady mid-tempo pace, moving from tender uncertainty toward clear-eyed optimism. The production is modern and natural, led by warm piano, clean electric guitar, restrained live-feeling drums, rounded bass, and subtle analog texture. Dynamics should remain open and human rather than heavily compressed, with the final chorus providing the widest and brightest moment.

### Vocal Details

An intimate lead vocal begins close and lightly breathy in the verses, with precise phrasing and a vulnerable tone. The delivery gains confidence as the song develops without becoming theatrical. Soft doubles may reinforce selected phrases, while compact harmony layers open around the chorus and expand modestly in the final repeat. Reverb stays warm and controlled so the words remain present.

### Arrangement

[Intro] Warm piano establishes the harmony alone before a faint analog pad and clean guitar harmonics enter at the edges.

[Verse] The lead vocal arrives over piano and sparse guitar arpeggios. Bass enters gradually, while percussion is limited to quiet pulse and texture.

[Chorus] Restrained drums settle into a complete groove as bass, wider guitar voicings, and vocal harmonies lift the arrangement. The transition should feel earned rather than abrupt.

[Final Chorus] The same core palette reaches its fullest scale with brighter piano octaves, broader harmonies, and a subtle sustained texture behind the band. End by letting the drums and bass fall away, leaving the opening piano color to resolve naturally.`,

const SAMPLE_PROMPT = `subject_definitions:
<Subject 1> is the coffee shop in <Picture 1>, with a brick wall, orange sofa, neon sign, and wooden table.
<Subject 2> is the white Samoyed in <Picture 2> and <Picture 3>, with pointed ears and a curved tail.
<Subject 3> is the blonde woman in <Video 1>, wearing a pink shirt.
<Subject 4> is the brown-haired man in a grey hoodie from <Video 2>.
<Audio 1> is the voice-timbre reference for <Subject 3> (S1), containing a spoken English vocal layer.

summary:
[reference generation + audio reference] In a three-shot sitcom scene, <Subject 3> eats a cookie inside <Subject 1>. <Subject 4> enters with <Subject 2>, which lunges toward the cookie. <Audio 1> guides <Subject 3>'s voice timbre, and a canned audience laugh ends the exchange.

retention_analysis:
<Subject 1> (appears in all shots): fully_preserved - its layout and key furniture are retained.
<Subject 2> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2]): fully_preserved - its white fur and silhouette are retained.
<Subject 3> (appears in all shots): fully_preserved - her identity and wardrobe are retained.
<Subject 4> (appears in [Shot 1], [Shot 2]): fully_preserved - his identity and wardrobe are retained.
<Audio 1>: reference - its vocal timbre guides <Subject 3> without copying the signal.

detailed_description:
The target video uses a realistic multi-camera sitcom style with warm indoor lighting.
[Shot 1] A medium shot establishes <Subject 1>. <Subject 3> (S1) sits on the sofa holding a cookie. <Subject 4> enters holding <Subject 2>'s leash. The Samoyed lunges toward the cookie. <Subject 3> jerks it back and, using the voice timbre from <Audio 1>, exclaims, <d>[English] Hey! Watch your dog!</d> She guards the cookie while <Subject 4> pulls the dog back.
[Shot 2] At 00:03.000, cut to <Subject 4> (S2) holding <Subject 2> securely. In a playful tone he says, <d>[English] He just likes cookies more than me.</d> He smiles apologetically and strokes the dog's fur.
[Shot 3] At 00:05.000, cut to <Subject 3> (S1). Her annoyance softens. Using <Audio 1>'s timbre, she replies, <d>[English] Well, he has good taste at least.</d> She raises the cookie as a canned audience laugh continues to the final frame.

overall_soundscape:
Soft indoor coffee-shop room tone continues throughout the scene.
