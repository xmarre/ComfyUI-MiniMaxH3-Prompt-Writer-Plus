H3 Prompt Writer is a prompt-writing workspace for MiniMax H3 inside ComfyUI. Start with a plain-language Creative Brief, add optional image, video, or audio references, and generate an editable prompt in the format expected by H3.

It is a ComfyUI UI extension, not a workflow node. It writes prompt text for your existing H3 workflow. It does not run MiniMax H3, change the graph, or queue a video.

ComfyUI extension: **0.4.4** · [Download ZIP](https://github.com/duckyshell/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Prompt-Writer/releases/download/v0.4.4/H3-Prompt-Writer-ComfyUI-v0.4.4.zip) · [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

## What it does

You do not need to write MiniMax section headings, timestamps, or reference syntax by hand. Describe the video and tell Writer what each reference should contribute:

```text
Use <Picture 1> for character appearance, <Picture 2> for clothes, and only the movement from <Video 1>. The character walks through a rainy Tokyo street at night.
```

Writer sends your brief, selected mode, prepared references, and the official MiniMax prompt-writing guide to the chosen prompt model. The result is an editable H3 prompt. You can change it directly, use **Refine** for a revision, or select **Copy prompt** and paste it into your H3 workflow.

For longer shots, choose **H3 Continuum** as the output target. Writer creates one sequence-wide H3 preamble plus canonical Timeline sections such as `[0-5s]`, `[5-10s]`, and later spans for the [H3 Continuum](https://github.com/ukr8b3g-cmyk/ComfyUI-H3-Continuum) V3.4–V3.7 sampler family. Continuum prepends the shared preamble to every resolved chunk, so persistent identity, reference roles, wardrobe, environment, style, camera, lighting, audio rules, and exclusions can remain truly sequence-wide. This is a separate target, not another H3 mode; T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, and Reference keep their existing media semantics.

## Key features

- T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, and Reference modes.
- Up to 9 images, 3 videos, and 3 audio references in Reference mode.
- Clear `<Picture N>`, `<Video N>`, and `<Audio N>` labels for assigning identity, wardrobe, setting, motion, camera, sound, or other roles.
- In-place Reference media replacement from the card action or by dropping one file directly on a card, without rebuilding the surrounding asset order.
- Ordered video contact sheets with visible frame-sampling controls, so you can inspect what the prompt model sees.
- Official MiniMax base and Reference guides included for all five modes.
- Editable prompts, **Refine**, **Copy prompt**, and a separate saved draft for every mode.
- Native H3 Continuum sequences from 1 to 16 chunks at 4 to 30 seconds per chunk (5–15 seconds recommended), with a shared sequence preamble, canonical Timeline output, chunk-local refinement, and an explicit **Apply to Continuum** handoff.
- Continuum derives public reference identities from the selected supported sampler topology: active **Reference Image** inputs own compact `<Picture 1..N>` numbering in hybrid runs; without Reference Images, **First Frame** and **Last Frame** own compact temporal `<Picture N>` identities; **Video Reference** is `<Video 1>`; **Reference Audio** on V3.5+ is persistent `<Audio 1>`; **Driving Audio** is persistent conditioning with no `<Audio N>` prompt tag. V3.7's optional Still Image Guide remains workflow-owned and untagged.
- Native [Image Conveyor](https://github.com/xmarre/ComfyUI-Image-Conveyor) compatibility resolves its effective runtime outputs instead of trusting saved wires: disabled or empty persistent Reference Shelf slots stay out of the Continuum Picture inventory, Main/Last Frame switches are honored, and Queue execution groups follow **Images per execution**. In **Reference + H3 Continuum**, the Media section also shows the currently active workflow image slots and provides **Add active workflow refs** so stable Conveyor Reference Shelf / Load Image pixels can be inspected by the prompt model and bound to the same downstream identities. A stable reference passed through the reviewed `ImageScaleToTotalPixelsX` **Scale Image to Total Pixels Adv** node is materialized before import when it uses static megapixel/multiple/crop-pad-stretch settings and **Lanczos**, so Writer sees the resized/cropped image that actually reaches H3 instead of the pre-transform source.
- Automatic context planning and clear controls for releasing local prompt models and ComfyUI VRAM.

## Choose a provider

| Provider | Choose it when | Setup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Ollama](docs/OLLAMA.md) | You want the simplest local setup | Install Ollama and pull a vision model |
| [Direct GGUF](docs/DIRECT_GGUF.md) | You want Writer to load a supported GGUF inside ComfyUI | Install the optional native runtime and add a matching GGUF + `mmproj` pair |
| [External llama.cpp](docs/EXTERNAL_LLAMA_SERVER.md) | You already run llama.cpp or want full control over its runtime | Start `llama-server`; add a matching `mmproj` for images and video |
| [API providers](docs/API_PROVIDERS.md) | You want Gemini, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or a Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Connect a key or an existing endpoint such as LM Studio |

Not sure? Start with [Ollama](docs/OLLAMA.md). The [provider guide](docs/PROVIDERS.md) explains the differences. The Ollama and Direct GGUF guides contain the tested local model choices.

## Quick start

1. Install **MiniMax H3 Prompt Writer** from ComfyUI Manager and restart ComfyUI.
2. Open the floating **H3 Prompt Writer** button or use **Extensions > H3 Prompt Writer**. No graph node will appear.
3. Open **Settings** and choose a provider. For the recommended local setup and an 8 GB starting tier, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download), open the app, and run:

   ```text
   ollama pull gemma4:e4b
   ```

4. Choose a mode, add its media, and write a Creative Brief.
5. Select **Generate prompt**, review the editable result, then copy it into your H3 workflow.

To write a longer sequence, select **H3 Continuum**, choose the chunk count and seconds per chunk, then select **Generate sequence**. See [H3 Continuum sequences](docs/USAGE.md#h3-continuum-sequences).

## Privacy and limitations

- With Direct GGUF, External llama.cpp, a local Custom endpoint, or Ollama on this computer, the prompt request and prepared media stay on the local machine. A remote Ollama host receives the brief, instructions, and prepared visual inputs.
- With a remote API provider, the required brief, instructions, prepared images, and video contact sheets are sent to the selected provider. Original video and audio bytes are not uploaded by Writer. Read [What leaves this computer](docs/API_PROVIDERS.md#what-leaves-this-computer) before using private media.
- Video understanding uses the ordered contact sheet shown in the preview, not every frame of the encoded video.
- Prompt models do not listen to uploaded audio. Describe the soundtrack, voice, rhythm, or other audio role in the Creative Brief.
- Continuum can declare downstream workflow references without copying their pixels into the prompt-model request. A workflow-only Reference Image can therefore keep its `<Picture N>` identity while remaining unseen by the prompt model; describe its intended role in the Creative Brief instead of expecting visual inference.
- The interface and documentation are in English. Briefs can use other languages, and Writer preserves supplied dialogue and visible text.
- Gemma 4 remains the simplest tested local choice. Direct GGUF also supports Qwen 3.8, compatible Qwen 3.8 fine-tunes, and Qwen3-VL. Untested compatible models may behave differently from the verified pairs.
- Ollama, External llama.cpp, and compatible API endpoints let you try other multimodal models that accept images. Compatibility does not guarantee a good H3 prompt.
- External llama.cpp also accepts text-only models for Music 3, T2VA, ordinary text-only Refine, and H3 Continuum modes whose visual conditioning stays workflow-only. Prompt Writer image/video analysis still needs a vision model.
- Direct GGUF supports Gemma 4, Qwen 3.8, compatible Qwen 3.8 fine-tunes, and Qwen3-VL. The tested Qwen 3.8 and Qwen3-VL model and projector pairs are marked as verified. Other compatible combinations are marked as unverified. A missing projector leaves text-only T2VA plus workflow-only H3 Continuum available.
- Gemini and a Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint were tested live. OpenAI and OpenRouter have automated contract coverage but were not tested live with commercial credentials. Comfy Cloud has not been validated for v0.3.
